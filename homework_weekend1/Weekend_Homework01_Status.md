### Weekend Homework 1

- [x] ~~Create a new GitHub repository for your project.~~
- [x] ~~Invite all members of your group to collaborate on the repository.~~
- [ ] Write a simple README.md file explaining your project.
- [ ] Modify and expand the `Chef GPT script` by incorporating a unique personality for your AI chef.
  - [ ] Tweak the system prompt to include a unique personality for your AI chef.
  - Example personalities:
    - A young, enthusiastic Indian chef specializing in Biryani
    - A seasoned Italian chef with a passion for pasta-making
    - An old Brazilian grandma who loves to cook classic dishes
- [ ] Develop individual scripts for each group member, each featuring a distinct AI chef personality.
- [ ] Program the AI to respond to three specific types of user inputs:
  - [ ] Ingredient-based dish suggestions
  - [ ] Recipe requests for specific dishes
  - [ ] Recipe critiques and improvement suggestions
- [ ] Give enough instructions in the system prompt to make the AI conform to give the responses according to the scenarios above.
  - [ ] Implement the following logic:
    - If the user's initial input doesn't match these scenarios, politely decline and prompt for a valid request.
    - For ingredient inputs: Suggest only dish names without full recipes.
    - For dish name inputs: Provide a detailed recipe.
    - For recipe inputs: Offer a constructive critique with suggested improvements.
  - Ideally, the same AI would be able to handle the three scenarios above.
    - But if you can't get the same AI to do that, you can make three different scripts for each personality to proceed with your project.
- [ ] Conduct a comprehensive experiment:
  - [ ] The first person should use one script with one personality to suggest a dish based on given ingredients.
    - After running the script, send the response for one of your group members (via Discord or any other means).
  - [ ] The second person should request a recipe for that dish using a second script with a different personality.
    - After running the script, send the response for another of your group members.
  - [ ] The third person should critique the provided recipe using a third script with a different personality.
- [ ] Compile a simple report documenting:
  - The experiment process
  - The system prompts used in each script
  - Comparative analysis of the different user prompts and their responses
- [ ] Submit your completed project through the designated submission form.
